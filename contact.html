More than 5 years ago, I decided that it was high time I began writing. The first thing I wrote, I decided to publish. 
That taught me a lot; one of the lessons I acquired during that period was that my writing was nowhere near what I wanted it to be, so I kept to myself, but I also kept practicing.
